For doing technical analysis for option traders, the Option Chain is the most important tool for deciding entry and exit strategies.
The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has a website which displays the option chain for traders in near real-time. This program retrieves this data from the NSE site and then generates useful analysis of the Option Chain for the specified Index or Stock from the NSE website.
It also continuously refreshes the Option Chain and visually displays the trend in various indicators and useful for Technical Analysis.
Calculations are based on [Mr. Sameer Dharaskar's Course](http://advancesharetrading.com/).

## Data Displayed

>#### Table Data:

Data | Description
--- | ---
Server Time | *Web Scraped*. Indicates last data update time by NSE server 
Value | *Web Scraped*. Underlying Instrument Value indicates the value of the underlying Security or Index
Call Sum | Calculated. Sum of the Changes in Call Open Interest contracts of the given Strike Price and the next immediate two Strike Prices (In Thousands for Index Mode and Tens for Stock Mode)
Put Sum | Calculated. Sum of the Change in Put Open Interest contracts of the given Strike Price and the next two Strike Prices (In Thousands for Index Mode and Tens for Stock Mode)
Difference | Calculated. Difference between the Call Sum and Put Sum. If its very -ve its bullish, if its very +ve then its bearish else its a sideways session. 
Call Boundary | Change in Call Open Interest contracts for 2 Strike Prices above the given Strike Price. This is used to determine if Call writers are taking new positions (Bearish) or exiting their positions (Bullish). (In Thousands for Index Mode and Tens for Stock Mode)
Put Boundary | Change in Put Open Interest for the given Strike Price. This is used to determine if Put writers are taking new positions (Bullish) or exiting their positions(Bearish). (In Thousands for Index Mode and Tens for Stock Mode)
Call In The Money(ITM) | This indicates that bullish trend could continue and Value could cross 4 Strike Prices above given Strike Price. It's calculated as the ratio of Put writing and Call writing at the 4th Strike Price above the given Strike price. If the absolute ratio > 1.5 then its bullish sign. 
Put In The Money(ITM) | This indicates that bearish trend could continue and Value could cross 2 Strike Prices below given Strike Price. It's calculated as the ratio of Call writing and Put writing at the 2nd Strike Price below the given Strike price. If the absolute ratio > 1.5 then its bearish sign. 

>#### Label Data:

Data | Description
--- | ---
Open Interest Upper Boundary | Highest and 2nd Highest(highest in OI boundary range) Call Open Interest contracts (In Thousands for Index Mode and Tens for Stock Mode) and their corresponding Strike Prices
Open Interest Lower Boundary | Highest and 2nd Highest(highest in OI boundary range) Put Open Interest contracts (In Thousands for Index Mode and Tens for Stock Mode) and their corresponding Strike Prices
Open Interest | This indicates if the latest OI data record indicates Bearish or Bullish signs near Indicated Strike Price. If the Call Sum is more than the Put Sum then the OI is considered Bearish as there is more Call writing than Puts. If the Put Sum is more than the Call sum then the OI Is considered Bullish as the Put writing exceeds the Call writing.
Put Call Ratio(PCR) | Sum Total of Put Open Interest contracts divided by Sum Total of Call Open Interest contracts
Call Exits | This indicates if the Call writers are exiting near given Strike Price in the latest OI data record. If the Call sum is < 0 or if the change in Call OI at the Call boundary (2 Strike Prices above the given Strike Price) is < 0, then Call writers are exiting their positions and the Bulls have a clear path.
Put Exits | This indicates if the Put writers are exiting near given Strike Price in the latest OI data record. If the Put sum is < 0 or if the change in Put OI at the Put boundary (the given Strike Price) is < 0, then Put writers are exiting their positions and the Bears have a clear path.
Call In The Money(ITM) | This indicates if the Call writers are also exiting far OTM strike prices (4 Strike Prices above the given Strike Price) showing extreme bullishness. Conditions are if the Call writers are exiting their far OTM positions and the Put writers are writing at the same Strike Price & if the absolute ratio > 1.5 then its bullish sign. This signal also changes to Yes if the change in Call OI at the far OTM is < 0.
Put In The Money(ITM) | This indicates if the Put writers are also exiting far OTM strike prices (2 Strike Prices below the given Strike Price) showing extreme bearishness.
